# 2 Player Battle Game (Ruby)

This is a simple two-player battle game, developed in Ruby. It demonstrates an understanding of object-oriented design, persistence through the use of sessions, front-end design using HTML and CSS as well as test-driven development using RSPEC and Capybara.

The complexity was intentionally kept to a minimum in order to present a clean, simple product.
